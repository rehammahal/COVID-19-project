# COVID19-project
This project is an exercise in data science and big data Bootcamp that organized by the Saudi society for data science.

This exercise is a case study for the second quarter of the 2020 year on the Covid-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia.

In this project, I apply all that I learned in data science and analysis so far.
The goal of this project to handling with datasets and wrangling data from missing values and reformat them, binning, grouping, apply some descriptive statistical, and finally visualization for results.
